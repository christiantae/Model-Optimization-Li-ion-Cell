# Equivelent Circuit Model (ECM) Parameter Identification for Li-ion Cell
The code folder contains the Matlab files used to run the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Bayesian Optimization, and gradient descent for fitting the ECM parameters for a Li-ion cell. A Simulink model was implemented to replicate the behavior of the ECM. Once the appropriate parameters were found, the ECM model was then validated across real-life experimental data for an NMC/graphite Sony Li-ion cell.
